* After uploading a theme, redirected back to settings for theme selection

* Fix for navigation config setup by installer - no longer need to edit navigation and save to show menu on first install
* Make sure to use the un-tick the "active" checkbox to hide pages in the navigation. Delete will remove this completely, but any page that exists will be added back next time the manage navigation page is saved.Delete should be used for pages which have been removed.
* Sub-menu re-ordering bug fixed 

*BLOG*
* Author meta tag is now controlled in the settings - with language settings
* New Tag!
{{blog-list:blog:title,author,date:5}} 
If you want to add further control to this tag. The second parameter is the lines to show author/date/title and the last is the number of items on a page.
* Blog dates in the past can now be selected
* Blog posts now appear in reverse (correct) order
* Order is now controlled by date and then by the ID/filename
So for blog posts you make a blog post and Champion gives you a random string like 201809018898.txt? You can change the name of that post and the URL if you want. When you change the date of the post this affects the order.
* Blog tag descriptions and titles can now be added. It's linked off the "extend" part of the settings page. And can be viewed when viewing a tag.
* URLs issue fixed. It's not necessary to change the .htaccess file for blog item pages now.
* Blog Draft mode is now fixed. Add "draft" before blog file name to put it in draft mode so "draft1". Delete "draft" to put it live! No more dashes.

*LANGUAGE* 
* Folder new page/block language setting added #3
* More unicode allowed
* Updated language strings for all 8 included languages

*POLICY TAG* 
* Now show country and location correctly: 

*SOCIAL TAG*
* Social tags url bug fixed

*SEARCH* 
* Removed JSON from search results:

*THEMES*
* The fix handles the case where the theme files are in the root of the zip file. Previously, the theme files had to be in a folder (with the same name as the theme) in the zip archive.

*WYSIWYG*
* PDFs can be added using the WYSIWYG editor. But if they don't appear PDF embedding can be done using the object tag eg:
<object width="400" height="400" data="[base url]/content/media/testpdf.pdf"></object>

* Also default password added to admin/install.php so clearer how to log in before changing the default password in settings (short term access)

FIX

* Redactor update to 2.12
* Navigation in dashboard is now no longer hard coded and responding to lang files
* Added Czech, Slovak and updated Polish, Hungarian to Redactor languages
* Fixed language selection bug for Redactor
* More width to inline editing so easier to edit
* Fixed links so images appear in Redactor in demo site
* German language file update
* German fixes for special characters in backend and inline editing

## Champion 5.0:

* Config.php now replaced by JSON storage in a folder called ~~XENO~~ championcore
* JSON will open up _lots_ of possibilities for 3rd Party Developers to get into :)
* JSON also means password is now no longer able to be seen in plain text.  The password is hashed and salted and no longer printed naked in config file - using bcrypt. Is now as strong as the server and difficult to hack.
* New settings page - control all from settings. No longer need to edit config.php when install just upload and go to /admin/ (password is "demo"). If want to edit on the code level championcore > storage > config.json / but shouldn't be needed. Config.php is just needed for the initial login.
* Latest Redactor I added with video button. Will move to II or III soon.
* Redactor II added. Sharp and sleek icons in the toolbar and more plugin compatibility and bug fixes in the editor
* Forgot password added. Sends email to user registered in settings.
* Customise login stylesheet added in admin / admin.css so designers can easily style the login page
* 2 step authentication added - this is **_cool_** - so can lock down with smartphone verification for extra security with a secret key. Use Google Authenticator app to access Champion admin, along with usual password.
* Settings now has dropdown option for all time zones
* All language files will be included in drop down on install. German and English currently but all baked in soon
* Easy to flip front end home page from home > blog - if want to land on blog
* Can flip admin landing page to dashboard, blog, stats etc for more customised login
* Can use Redactor Editor on Pages or just HTML. No longer client scary!
* New user editor added. This user cannot see settings page and only edit content. Good for client user. Designer (admin) can change their password (which is also hashed) and add 2 step authentication. This also includes secure forgot password emailing backup. 
* Designer can also restrict what pages / blocks editor can edit. For example, just want to create a blog for a client, you can do that now. Or We definitely do not want editors going into the pages section. They already find it hard to understand the concept.  
* Form now has SMTP settings in the settings page
* Themes chooser - you can add more themes in the template folder in sub-folders and select them from settings dropdown for easy template changing on the site.
* Themes can also be set per page too for multi-theme sites.
* Blog now has tags in the META drawer, which can be seen on the front end too and when clicked show all posts in that tag. Blogs posts have the list of tags at the end of the post e.g. "#tag1 #tag2". If no tags are selected then the tag list at the end of the blog post does not appear.
* There is a tag widget for editing tags!
* Each blog post now has individual title + description meta tags - different to the blog page also which has it's own (SEO upgrade).
* Sitemaps auto-generated and placed in root as sitemap.xml including blog posts (thanks to Tim again for the idea!)
* New page or block creation now has a radio button for "page" or "folder" and auto adds .txt to pages and blocks so more user-friendly.
* Embed individual blocks on pages like Champion v3. Embed URLs are now included for blog, blocks and galleries to add to non Champion template pages that are in the same folder (gives the option of template driven like in v4 and non-template like v3). Two options: relative & site specific - to cover both use cases. So you can also embed on same site other sites so in effect, controlling many sites from 1 Champion install is also possible!
* Security fix - https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2016020228
* Markdown now in Blocks
* Various RSS & Blog error fixes 
* Error reporting is now always on for developers
* Added "MORE" to Redactor toolbar
* htaccess/index.php sanitisation for private directories and turning off access to private urls. Adding rules to the .htaccess to block access too.
* Custom post types added and a new Champion tag. The idea is that a site selling books (for example) would have fields for ISBN, cover image, date published, price, availability etc. These can be created and managed from the settings panel. Then using the new tag, for example {{custom_post_type:book/hercules}} the custom post data will appear on the front end. Useful for listing data or create e-commerce sites.
* Upload images can now be resampled or original quality. Good for creating an upload repository for photographers for example.
* Gallery outline bug fixed
* New Feature - Drag and drop navigation UI found under settings. Much easier to create navigation over sb_nav.txt for users who don't want to edit HTML links.
* Bug fix - Text position focus moves when doing a "save"
* RSS now works with http or https + tag content now appears in rss.php
* Champion tags now work when website is located in a sub folder
* Top referrers in Stats links now fixed
* Link to switch to a textarea (and back) for the case where low-level edits are needed on a per block basis (not just in settings) - works pages and blog entries too 
* New tag to add One Time Password to any page on front-end - not just password plugin using: {{sb_login:test:1234567890:testblock}}
* Latest Redactor Editor includes many bug fixes, better mobile use, support for powerful codemirror in HTML mode, classes/ids on images for things like animation or lightboxes, added snippets (such as "more" for blog posts), can paste as plain text automatically and many more...
* Ordered lists and un-ordered lists now appear in editor
* Draft blog feature! Add "draft-" before blog file name to put it in draft mode so "draft-1.txt" etc. Delete "draft-" to put it live!
* Migrate / Import blog feature! Import your Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogger, RapidWeaver or any blog using an RSS / atom feed and migrate to Champion without manually porting it over! Text, videos and images included.
* Blog import even more in-depth and powerful! Options added for the page extension name and max number of pages for a deeper and wider RSS crawl. It's now a more flexible approach to different kinds of sources and will loop through even long and heavy WordPress blogs over multiple pages with 100s of blog posts!
* Default timezone now JP baby!
* Reqs information now included in admin/install.php for easier server checking after uploading (diag.php now install.php)
* Recommend in most cases run the admin/install.php page firstly to auto-set the path, no need to set it and will run super smoothly!
* Anyone still using less than PHP 5.6 gets redirected to install.php to make them realise they have to upgrade - even PHP 5.3 ended security support in August 2014! Minimum now PHP 5.6
* Auto focus on input fields when page loads for easier user experience
* Latest jQuery included! (3.x.x)
* Security fix for Contact Form - latest version of PHP Mailer added

* More language variables added for Bounce rate in stats, Blog UI meta data, title, description and the embed instruction
* Forms, Gallery, Slider tags better compatibility with Champion in sub folders

* Updated to magnified popup 1.10 for the gallery

* htaccess fix to allow get parameter passing in rewritten urls
* Stats fonts now fit better on the page
* Fix of allow array 
* UTF-8 in all blocks so non English characters now render correctly
* Form fix to block page reload sending the email again
* Champion Cloud - now one license for unlimited sites. Join the Champion Cloud today to get unlimited sites, updates, premium addons, form builder app (to make multi-page interactive forms and surveys with form logic and stats), Champion 5 when it drops, and many more exclusive things:

* New Just Forms Tag included in the Champion Core. Just add {{justforms}} to any page followed by options for form ID and form height and you can easily embed your forms e.g {{justforms:formid:height}} so {{justforms:1:300}} / Requires a Champion Cloud subscription to make forms
* Gorgeous new default theme! Colourful, bright and simple - shows the power of Champion and finally modernises the default site. Uses two alternate templates too, to show that in action
* Standard Contact form auto responder for the {{form}} tag - any contact form submissions will automatically receive a thank you email from the admin address in config.php. You can change the message in the language files
* Blog single posts now have "back" button to return to blog top page
* Multilingual out of the box! Use the {{localizer:block}} tag to translate your content into any language you want. And use links like <a href="?locale=de">Deutsch</a> to change the language.

What's changed?
A lot! Keep reading.. get a coffee ☕ and run through it:
CHAMPIONCORE

Config.php now replaced by JSON storage in a folder called "championcore"
JSON will open up _lots_ of possibilities for 3rd Party Developers to get into :)

JSON also means password is now no longer able to be seen in plain text. The password is hashed and
salted and no longer printed naked in config file - using bcrypt. Is now as strong as the server and difficult
to hack.
New settings page - control all from settings. No longer need to edit config.php when install just upload
and go to /admin/ (password is "demo"). If want to edit on the code level championcore > storage > config.json
/ but shouldn't be needed. Config.php is just needed for the initial login.
Settings now has dropdown option for all time zones
You can now include blocks outside of the main Champion page area and still process Champion tags within them.
E.g in template <?php include("path/block.txt"); ?> and tags inside Blocks will be processed
Championcore added to template.php to style core elements needed like buttons or blog tags, but designers
can leave out or override with their stylesheets should they wish
USERS
New user "Editor" added. This user cannot see settings page and only edit content. Good for client user.
Designer (admin) can change their password (which is also hashed) and add 2 step authentication. This
also includes secure forgot password emailing functionality.
Designer can also restrict what pages / blocks editor can edit. For example, just want to create a blog for a
client, you can do that now. Or we definitely do not want editors going into the pages section. They already
find it hard to understand the concept.
TEXT EDITOR
Latest Redactor Editor includes many bug fixes, better mobile use, support for powerful codemirror in
HTML mode, classes/ids on images for things like animation or lightboxes, added snippets (such as "more"
for blog posts), can paste as plain text automatically and many more…
Redactor II added. Sharp and sleek icons in the toolbar and more plugin compatibility and bug fixes in the
editor
Can use Redactor Editor on Pages or just HTML. No longer client scary!
Added "MORE" to Redactor toolbar
Redactor Font colour, Font family and Font size options added!
Markdown now in Blocks
Issue with pasted links in a text.
Improved some improvements when a text inserting from MS Word
Spammails are annoying. Easily and securely paste an email address into a Block with a button - which
auto makes mailto: and (mailto: and) @ in the source code, so invisible to all spambots
Videos embedded from YouTube/Vimeo or other sites will be automatically responsive and display in
columns of narrow width or on mobile devices.
BLOCKS

Blocks can now move folders! There is a select below the text editor.
New page or block creation now has a radio button for "page" or "folder" and auto adds .txt to pages and
blocks so more user-friendly.
Pages and Blocks creation - no need to type .txt! And if file or folder select from the radio buttons
Embed individual blocks on non Champion template pages liken previous Champion versions. Embed URLs are now
included for blog, blocks and galleries to add to non Champion template pages that are in the same folder
(HTML and PHP options).
LOGIN
Forgot password added. Sends email to user registered in settings.
Customize login stylesheet added in admin / admin.css so designers can easily style the login page
2 step authentication added - this is **_cool_** - so can lock down with smartphone verification for extra
security with a secret key. Use Google Authenticator app to access Champion admin, along with usual
password.
Login has it's own CSS file login.css to make it easy to customize the login screen.
Gorgeous login UI added 
and his popular Aero login addon. Image, icon can be changed in the "Branding" folder and colors easy to
change in the admin.css
SECURITY
Security fix for Contact Form - latest version of PHP Mailer added
Error reporting is now always on for developers
Various security fixes and tighten of file permissions and other things 
New tag to add One Time Password to any page on front-end - not just password plugin using:
{{sb_login:test:1234567890:testblock}}
Latest jQuery included! (3.x.x)
Sanitisation for private directories and turning off access to private urls. Adding rules to the .htaccess to
block access too.
htaccess and index.html files added in some directories to stop content and stats being reached from an
absolute URL - more security features
Offsite emailed backup to admin's email so a backup is kept on the server and off the server. This can still
be switched off in the settings.
LANGUAGES
Admin UI ships in English, German, Japanese, Dutch, Hungarian, Polish, Czech and Slovak. These can be
easily changed in-app with the new Language Selector in Settings
WYSIWYG Editor is also translated to those language for a full localised experience

Multilingual out of the box! Use the {{localizer:block}} tag to translate your content into any language you
want. And use links like <a href="?locale=de">Deutsch</a> to change the language on your site.
UTF-8 in all blocks so non English characters now render correctly
More language variables added for Bounce rate in stats, Blog UI meta data, title, description and the
embed instruction
Language variables added to signup / email list block
SEO
Sitemaps auto-generated and placed in root as sitemap.xml including blog posts
OGP Tags
Each blog post now has individual title + description meta tags - different to the blog page also which has
it's own (SEO upgrade)

PLUGINS
Plugins can now also be updated! Drop the Zip into settings then start using the Tag in your blocks and
pages!

The number of Tag variables (for developers) is now 6
CUSTOM POST TYPES
Custom post types added and a new Champion tag. The idea is that a site selling books (for example) would
have fields for ISBN, cover image, date published, price, availability etc. These can be created and
managed from the settings panel. Then using the new tag, for example

Some great updates to the Blog engine. Now there are blog-related tags:
{{blog:"":[[featured-image]] [[blog-content-loop(<<blog-item-author>> <<blog-item-date>> <<blog-item featured-image>> <<blog-item-content>>)]]}}

So you can layout if you want your blog page to show author (taken from admin or editor names) date,
featured images (add in media folder "featured_images" and the main content) or move these around in
order of appearance. (The old {blog}} tag will still work. The first parameter to the blog tag is an optional
prefix so passing an empty string keeps that working. You can add in here (without the "") the name of the
blog to embed one of your blogs. Any of the square bracket tags can be left off, although blog-contentloop is needed to show the items)
There is a tag widget for editing tags!
Gorgeous date picker added for blog posts!
The blog meta data for the date now uses the date format set in the config. The blog-item-date tag is
responsible for formatting the date for display. Easier to setup and localisation!
The locale and timezone are now set in one place in settings
The date is now locale sensitive so dates showing in language and locale!
The settings have a blog date format which can be adjusted to include the day of week or time. The actual
date still needs to be formatted here
Extra Meta data added for blog posts and pages. Checkboxes for nofollow/index and support for custom
meta to fine-tune your SEO settings
Blogs now have a url meta field!
RSS blog import converts input to UTF-8
Blog layout now has Masonry option!! This can be found in the settings
Blog list tag added for listing short version of the blog list items {{blog-list:"blog"}}. This shows the
title/author/date for a blog
Have more than 1 blog per Champion site! New tag - "blog-show" for showing any blog. For the blogs, subfolders in the blog directory hold the blog data. Its exactly like Pages/Blocks
Blog single posts now have "back" button to return to blog top page
Blog preview button has the proper single post blog link!
There is now a blog and page "duplicate" button to make it easier to add more of the same content
This includes featured images for blog posts!
Now add {{blog-tags}} (new tag) {{blog-tags:"blog"}} and prints all blog tags so can select what want to
read - with numbers for amount of posts in each, and links!
Pagination is now also added for blog - so no longer just "next" and "previous" but numbers also for
quicker access to bigger blogs
STATS
Stats UI improvements in some languages & more variables added
New Stats! Browsers, countries, devices and Systems added to stats package.
PERFORMANCE

New - there is now a cache layer on the front end output so sites are much faster as the server doesn't
have to render the plug-ins or do any file handling etc. so good for performance. Exists for 24 hours and
can be switched on/off in settings
Cache added! So front end content appears faster and more reliable in the browser to speed up your Champion
sites even more!
FORMS
Form fix to block page reload sending the email again
Form builder app - Just Forms added (to make multi-page interactive forms and surveys with form logic
and stats)
New Just Forms Tag included in the Champion Core. Just add {{justforms}} to any page followed by options for
form ID and form height and you can easily embed your forms e.g {{justforms:formid:height}} so
{{justforms:1:300}}
Standard Contact form auto responder for the {{form}} tag - any contact form submissions will
automatically receive a thank you email from the admin address in config.php. You can change the
message in the language files
Form now has SMTP settings in the settings page
reCAPTCHA added to the built-in contact {{form}} tag
Config / settings edit option for contact form subject line has been added
Option added to easily redirect {{form}} tag to a page upon successful submission. More than just a
success message this can take users to a "thank you" page.
