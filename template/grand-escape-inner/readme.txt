# Welcome to the Grand Escape Inner template

This is the template to use for blog posts or more "vanilla" pages.
(Note: If you use the hero image Grand Escape theme, it won't work with
ChampionCMS blogs, which is 1 reason this template was made.)

Testing or editing? Here is a sanity check:
a. Test on mobile, ensure it looks OK.
b. Test the mobile menu button- does it show/hide the menu? It can easily break if you edit CSS.
c. Test it while logged in on desktop. Ensure the logo isn't broken and the blogs look Ok. Nothing should look squished.
