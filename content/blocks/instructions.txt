</ul><p><strong>Media:</strong>
</p><ul>
	<li>Add new photos to the media folder. This can be done through Champion, or through FTP
	<ul>
		<li>good practice - use all lowercase, and no spaces in the file name. </li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>also - I put the "size" of the photo in the name in px <ul><li>ex. "logo-300X125.jpg" is a 300px wide by 125px tall file</li></ul></li>
		<li>If you are replacing a picture - try to match the previous pictures dimensions</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>You can also add other types of files like pdfs into the media folder as well</li>
	<li>Some media "sub-folders" contain special pictures that are tied to a slideshow or "special effect" on the website. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Blog Posts:</strong>
</p><ul>
	<li>create new blog posts by adding a new file in the "blog" folder</li>
	<li>Also include "meta" content - Date (in the format mm-dd-yyyy) from the Date Picker pop-up & Title of the post</li>
	<li>Add "draft-" before the blog file name to put it in draft mode. So, for example, with "draft-1.txt" and "draft-2.txt" both these posts will be in draft mode.
	</li>
	<li>##more## can be used to truncate a post and only reveal a portion of it and have the rest hidden with a 'Read More' button.
	</li>
